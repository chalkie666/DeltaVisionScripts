This is a collection of scripts for running experiments on
a GE Healthcare DeltaVision Elite and OMX fluorescence microscopy systems, 
and misc scripts/tools to go along with that. 

For example, to work around limitations or do things
a different way than previously unimagined, that the 
SoftWoRx(r) gui can't yet manage. 

All these scripts are under an open source license.
See the LICENSE file for dedtails.  
They come with no warranty or promise of fitness for a cerain purpose. 
They are just examples illustrating what might be done.
These are not officially supported by GE Healthcare in any way. 
If stuff doesnt work out of the box, feel free to fix it
and send me a version that works that I can upload to this
code repository so others can benefit from your effort.
